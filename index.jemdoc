== About me
I received Bachelor of Technology(with distinction) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Shiv Nadar University([https://www.snu.edu.in SNU]) in 2019. In May 2019, I completed my undergraduate dissertation under [https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/ Prof. GPS Raghava] at [https://www.iiitd.ac.in/ IIIT Delhi]. The project was aimed at predicting binding sites in protein using machine learning. I am currently working at MIP Lab at CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad under Professor Jayanthi Sivaswamy.
