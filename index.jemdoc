== About me
I am currently working at CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad under Professor Jayanthi Sivaswamy. I am working on Explainable AI in Medical Diagnoses wherein the aim is to show doctors with evidence as to how the deep learning model came to a decision. I received Bachelor of Technology(with distinction) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Shiv Nadar University([https://www.snu.edu.in SNU]) in 2019. In May 2019, I completed my undergraduate dissertation under [https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/ Prof. GPS Raghava] at [https://www.iiitd.ac.in/ IIIT Delhi].
